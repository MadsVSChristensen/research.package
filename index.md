ResearchPackage is a Flutter [package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/research_package) for building research study apps on Android and iOS using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

ResearchPackage is a Flutter implementation of the [Apple ResearchKit](https://www.researchandcare.org/researchkit/) available for iOS (just like [ResearchStack](http://researchstack.org/) is for Android). The overarching goal of ResearchPackage is to enable developers and researchers to design and build cross-platform (iOS and Android) research applications using the same codebase. The API and UX design of ResearchPackage follows the API and UX of ResearchKit almost 1:1 (with a few adaptations to Flutter, including applying more to a reactive programming model).

ResearchPackage is designed from the ground up to meet the requirements of most scientific research, including capturing participant consent, extensible input tasks, and the security and privacy needs necessary for IRB approval.
The main features of ResearchPackage are:

- [Obtaining informed consent](consent) from participants, including support for a signature.
- [Creating surveys](survey) and questionnaires with a wide range of answer formats (e.g., likert scale, date pickers, image pickers, etc.), such as the [WHO5](https://www.psykiatri-regionh.dk/who-5/Documents/WHO5_English.pdf) survey.
- _[Creating cognitive tests](cognitive) or a batteri of tests from a diverse list of test possibilities. Research Package contains options to test for reaction time, motor function, working memory, attention fluid intelligence and more._

ResearchPackage is part of the overall CACHET Research Platform (CARP) with also provides a Flutter package for mobile and wearable sensing -- called [CARP Mobile Sensing](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_mobile_sensing). By combining ResearchPackage with CARP Mobile Sensing, support for what is called ["Active Tasks"](https://www.researchandcare.org/researchkit/) in ResearchKit can be implemented.

## Documentation

There is a set of tutorials, describing:

- the overall [software architecture](software-architecture) of ResearchPackage
- how to create an [informed consent](consent) flow
- how to define and run [user surveys](survey)
- _how to create a battery of [cognitive tests](create-cognitive-tests)_

The [ResearchPackage Flutter API](https://pub.dev/documentation/research_package/latest/) is available (and maintained) as part of the package release at pub.dev.

## Example Application

There is an [example application](https://github.com/cph-cachet/research.package/tree/master/example/research_package_demo_app) which demonstrates the different features of ResearchPackage as implemented in a Flutter app.

## Who is backing this project?

Research Package is made by the [Copenhagen Center for Health Technology (CACHET)](http://www.cachet.dk/) and is used in a number of applications and studies. The current project maintainers are [Barnab√°s Homola](https://github.com/barnabashomola), [Mads Vedel Saaby Christensen](https://github.com/MadsVSChristensen), and [Jakob E. Bardram](http://www.bardram.net).
